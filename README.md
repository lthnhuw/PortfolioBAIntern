# Le Thi Huynh Nhu - Business Analyst Intern Portfolio
# About
Hi, I’m Huynh Nhu.

I am a final-year Computer Science student at Can Tho University with a strong interest in business analysis and data-driven decision-making. I aspire to apply my analytical mindset and technical foundation in a professional environment, where I can support requirement gathering, process analysis, and data visualization to generate meaningful insights for stakeholders.

With a proactive attitude and willingness to learn, I am eager to collaborate with teams, communicate effectively, and approach problems from multiple perspectives to propose practical solutions. As I am nearing graduation, I am ready to dedicate my full focus and energy to contribute as a Business Analyst Intern at your company.
