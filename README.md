# Le Thi Huynh Nhu - Business Analyst Intern Portfolio
# About
Hi, I’m Huynh Nhu.

I am a final-year Computer Science student at Can Tho University with a strong interest in business analysis and data-driven decision-making. I aspire to apply my analytical mindset and technical foundation in a professional environment, where I can support requirement gathering, process analysis, and data visualization to generate meaningful insights for stakeholders.

With a proactive attitude and willingness to learn, I am eager to collaborate with teams, communicate effectively, and approach problems from multiple perspectives to propose practical solutions. As I am nearing graduation, I am ready to dedicate my full focus and energy to contribute as a Business Analyst Intern at your company.

<B> Key contributions: </B>  
- Analyzed business needs in library loan management and identified issues in the manual process.
- Gathered and documented requirements for two roles (reader, staff), developed use cases, process flows, and class diagrams.
- Designed wireframes and user interfaces to illustrate user interactions, proposed core features (book borrowing/returning, book/publisher management, reporting).
- Evaluated system limitations and suggested improvements


<B> Skills: </B> Requirements Analysis, UML (Use Case, Class Diagram), Process Modeling, Wireframing, UX Evaluation 

## <B> USDA Plant Species Clustering & Prediction</B>  
<B> Code: </B>  [USDA Plant Species Clustering & Prediction](https://github.com/lthnhuw/USDA-Plant-Species-Clustering-Prediction)  

<B> Description: </B> Analyzed USDA plant dataset to uncover species distribution patterns across U.S. regions. Generated visual insights and clustering analysis to support environmental planning and agricultural decision-making. 

<B> Key contributions: </B>  
- Collected, cleaned, and prepared dataset to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.
- Conducted exploratory and visual analysis to identify 3 major irregular distribution zones.
- Summarized findings from clustering models (DBSCAN vs. K-Means) to provide clear insights for non-technical stakeholders.
- Communicated results with visual dashboards, highlighting opportunities for biodiversity management.

<B> Skills: </B> Requirements Analysis, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Insight Communication , Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
## <B> Student Academic Records Management & Analysis with MySQL </B>  
<B> Code: </B> [Student Academic Records Management & Analysis with MySQL](https://github.com/lthnhuw/Projects/blob/main/student.sql) 

<B> Description: </B> Designed and implemented a relational database to store and manage student academic records, course details, and exam results for multiple faculties. Developed SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data for academic performance analysis, faculty statistics, and course participation insights.  

<B> Key contributions: </B>  
- Built a complete schema with 4 interrelated tables: khoa, sinhVien, hocPhan, ketQua.
- Implemented 20+ SQL queries to answer specific analytical questions:
  - Student filtering by age, faculty, and name patterns.
  - Identifying top-performing students and those at academic risk.
  - Listing most popular courses and courses without registrations.
  - Calculating pass/fail rates and faculty-level gender distribution.
- Applied constraints (CHECK, FOREIGN KEY) to ensure data integrity.
- Generated datasets for academic decision-making and operational reports.

<B> Skills: </B>  MySQL (DDL, DML, JOIN, aggregation, subqueries, constraints); relational database design; data filtering, sorting, and aggregation; query optimization basics.
## <B>Advanced SQL Programming: Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers & Transactions</B>  
<B> Code: </B>  [MySQL](https://github.com/lthnhuw/Projects/blob/main/project.sql)

<B> Description </B>:  Developed and implemented a set of stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, and transaction scripts in MySQL to demonstrate advanced database programming concepts for academic and portfolio purposes.  

<B> Key contributions: </B>
